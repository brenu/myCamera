## What it is?

It's just my personal implementation of an android camera app

## Tools

myCamera is entirely made by using React Native with Expo

## What's done

> - Take pictures
> - Video recording
> - Change between front and rear camera
> - Enable and disable flash
> - Zoom

## What I'm doing

> - Access to the gallery (working but not as it's supposed to)

## Todo list

> - Settings for the user to change the image/video quality
> - User Interface improvement (because it's DEFINITELY not that pretty)
> - HDR (It's more like a dream, because by now I have no ideia of how to do that)

## And if you want to...

You have the right to use the code of myCamera in another application of yours. Also, I would love to
receive some suggestions :D
